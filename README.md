# PyBer_Analysis


##Overview of the analysis
This analysis aims to provide ride-sharing data in a way that is informative to stakeholders and helps enhance project planning and decision-making. In addition, by visualizing the data, the information presented can be more quickly absorbed. One can detect trends, patterns, and outliers from the data set, which might be difficult to show from a table. The analysis is done on a large CSV file using pandas libraries, Jupiter notebook, and matplotlib to create a line chart that tracks the total monthly fares based on city type. This analysis is helpful for Pyber in improving access to ride-sharing services and determining affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

##Results:

The graph presented for the analysis shows that between 2019-01-01 till 2019-04-28, the weekly and monthly total fares of the urban city types are the highest among the Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. The analysis also shows that the higher urban city fares can be attributed to more rides and drivers in urban cities. The analysis conducted also shows that also the rural city types have the lowest total fares, total rides, and total drivers. However, they record the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The graph shows us no pattern in the variation of total fares between the three city types. However, we notice more variation in the fare of the rural city types, and the total fares of the suburban city types are more stable.

##Summary:

The information from this analysis leads to the following business recommendations:
-	Pyber management should implement strategies to increase the number of rides in the rural areas possible by providing customers in rural cities with more affordable fare rates.  
-	The company should also encourage new drivers to join by providing them with a higher average fare per driver
-	The CEO should encourage further analysis of the data set and factors that may account for the spike in total fares of all three city types in the last week of February, as indicated by the graph.
In conclusion, the CEO should encourage research into ways to increase the number of riders and customers and factors that can cause an increase in fares for all three city types.
